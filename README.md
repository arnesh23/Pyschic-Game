# Pyschic-Game#

This game is a letter guessing Game. It is built using HTML and Javascript. The browser listens for user input from the keyboard, and based on the letter which is hardcoded in the program, it does the following: 

Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly, 10 letters total!)

Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update, 10 tries for a letter)

Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
